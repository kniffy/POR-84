I still want to add in a few things:

* Currently on deletion of a user on the board it does not also delete the ftp
  user.. should be simple to inject some lines to do that

* The ftp-cmd stuff doesnt return any kind of display to the user.. the glAsh
  version of POR of course does do that, so I want to do the same

* The file area needs a rewrite - ZMODEM support at the very least, and a
  ZIPSCRIPT

* a pre/dupe search door... :)
