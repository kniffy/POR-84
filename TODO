I still want to add in a few things:

* It would be more sane to offload all of the config to the main x84 config
  file.. til then, this stays messy

* The ftp-cmd stuff doesnt return any kind of display to the user.. the glAsh
  version of POR of course does do that, so I want to do the same

* The file area needs a rewrite - ZMODEM support at the very least, and a
  ZIPSCRIPT
