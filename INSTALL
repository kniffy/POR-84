PROJECT OLDSKOOL REVENGE NEXT GENERATION

If any of you have tried to install daydream bbs and POR on a modern system
lately, its filled with bugs and broken in all kinds of weird ways, so here
is a functionality port of the POR we all love to x84 - pure python :)

As this is the initial version, it is very bare bones right now

REQUIREMENTS:

* I assume you already have a working glftpd, so I wont be giving any info on
  that in these docs

* I assume you also already kinda know how to work with x84, or are at least
  read up on the official x84 docs; either way, get a board running before
  installing this :)

* While not really a requirement, you should really put this board inside of
  a virtualenv.. makes it simpler

Alright, onto the instructions:

unpack the 'por-84' folder to someplace your virtualenv can reach, e.g:
 /home/user/x84/bmc/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/x84-2.0.13-py2.7.egg/x84/

from there, set your ~/.x84/default.ini scriptpath to that dir, e.g:
 scriptpath = /home/user/x84/bmc/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/x84-2.0.13-py2.7.egg/x84/por-84

Congrats, you're already running POR :) ..almost, anyway

CONFIGURATION:

This is pretty similar to the default x84 board with some modified files, and
a couple of extras:

* main.py	- the main menu script; we add in the ftp-cmd menu item
* matrix.py	- not much, but we add in a spot for yelling at users
* bmcnua.py	- the main magic, USER CREATION
* p.py		- the very excellent ftp-cmd script (its not excellent)
* superp.py	- special sYSOP version of the ftp-cmd's
* art/BMC-NEWS.TXT	- moved the spot of the newsfile to be easier to find

Now, only some of these *NEED* you to edit them - read all these please

* main.py

All this has is the menu items for the ftp-cmd's - note the 'sysop only' spots

* matrix.py

I injected a few lines for yelling at users below the art banner; feel free to
edit in your own or just comment them out

* bmcnua.py

To get the NEW USER CREATION working, you must edit bmcnua.py to point to
your glftpd install; make a special sysop user on the glftpd and put their
login details in the conf (plaintext, i know, but dont worry about that)

Feel free to change up the specific commands that are actually performed
if you know what you're doing :)

* p.py
* superp.py

To get the FTP-CMDs working, edit these files to point to a special ftp-cmd
user that does NOT have sysop access - site msg and request etc is all you can
really do at the moment, so the ftp-cmd user should have fancy powers

The superp.py file will magically know your board username, so all you gotta
config is what password you use on the board - naturally this will let you do
commands at whatever access level you have on site, which since you're sYSOP
is probably everything.. dont break your shit :p

* art/BMC-NEWS.TXT

I moved the newsfile to here since its easier to edit :)

Now, for the live site browsing from within the board, simply symlink to your
glftpd site dir (or subdirs) in the ~/x84-sftp_root/ dir :)

Personally, I leave a note telling users to use the FTP instead, but users can
at least go and step directories and see the nice file_id.diz's

Just remember users might stick some crap files into your dirs, since it lacks
any kind of built in zipscript.. version two maybe :)



Now you should have a working PROJECT OLDSKOOL REVENGE board :)

Greets to glAsh for having written POR in the first place, couldnt have done
this without that initial work :)

Come idle in:
